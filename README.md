ebook-utilz
===========

Utilities I use for ePub Creation  YMMV.

###doc2html
This will use OpenOffice and/or LibreOffice to produce pretty darn clean HTML at the backend, fit for our use with ePub.  Uses HTMLTidy and some specific SED expressions to smarten (yes, smarten) your quotes near-automagically.  It also embeds it into the base.html included in this repository.

###helper.sh
It helps us, it does.  Run in your OEPBS directory.

###refent.sh and refent.txt
A bash script and text file to bring up examples of reference entities and their corresponding codes.

###version_ebook.sh
So I can have versions without using (ironically, perhaps) Git.

###epubcheck.sh
A bash script to automagically call epubcheck and output the results to Zenity

###style.css
My style.css

###base.html
My base document when creating ePubs.

###content.opf
An example content.opf
